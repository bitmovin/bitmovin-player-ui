     * YouTube-style toggle button handling
     *
     * The goal is to prevent a short pause or playback interval between a click, that toggles playback, and a
     * double click, that toggles fullscreen. In this naive approach, the first click would e.g. start playback,
     * the second click would be detected as double click and toggle to fullscreen, and as second normal click stop
     * playback, which results is a short playback interval with max length of the double click detection
     * period (usually 500ms).
     *
     * To solve this issue, we defer handling of the first click for 200ms, which is almost unnoticeable to the user,
     * and just toggle playback if no second click (double click) has been registered during this period. If a double
     * click is registered, we just toggle the fullscreen. In the first 200ms, undesired playback changes thus cannot
     * happen. If a double click is registered within 500ms, we undo the playback change and switch fullscreen mode.
     * In the end, this method basically introduces a 200ms observing interval in which playback changes are prevented
     * if a double click happens.
